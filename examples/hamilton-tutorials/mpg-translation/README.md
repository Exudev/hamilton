# Translation exercise

This is a tutorial that one can use to help people grok Apache Hamilton.

The task is to translate the procedural code into Apache Hamilton. That is:

1. Translate either mpg_script.py or ProceduralMPGNotebook.ipynb into a Apache Hamilton.
2. There are two file stubs to fill in: `mpg_pipeline.py` or `MPGSimple.ipynb`.

If you get stuck or want to see the solution, you can look at `mpg_pipeline_target.py` or `MPGSimpleTarget.ipynb`.
These solutions represent a very straight port, and there are many ways to improve them.
The point to improving is to show that modifications and updates are quick and easy to make.

For a more advanced translation, you can look at the `mpg_pipeline_advanced.py` or `MPGSimpleAdvancedTarget.ipynb` files.

To get set up:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go into the `examples/hamilton-tutorials/mpg-translation` directory.
2. Install Apache Hamilton. `pip install - requirements.txt`
3. Write code.
4. Excute via notebook or command line.

Or run it in Google Colab:
