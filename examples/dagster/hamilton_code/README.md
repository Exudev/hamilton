# Apache Hamilton

![](./dataflow.png)
> Apache Hamilton dataflow materialization plan

## File structure

The Apache Hamilton refactor achieves the same data transformations. The project fits in essentially 2 files:
- `dataflow.py` contains regular Python functions to define the dataflow (equivalent to Dagster `tutorial/assets.py`).
- `run.py` contains the "driver code" to load and execute the dataflow (equivalent to Dagster `tutorial/__init__.py`).
- `notebook.ipynb` contains code to execute the dataflow (similar code to `run.py`), but allows for an interactive exploration of results.

The directory also include `mock_api.py` which simulates a `ressource` in the Dagster tutorial, and `dataflow.png` which is an artifact generated by the Apache Hamilton `Driver`.

## Instructions
1. Run the code
    ```console
    python run.py
    ```
