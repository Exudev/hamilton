# Narwhals

[Narwhals](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/) is a library that aims
to unify expression across dataframe libraries. It is meant to be lightweight
and focuses on python first dataframe libraries.

This examples shows how you can write dataframe agnostic code
and then load up a pandas or polars data to then use with it.

## Running the example

You can run the example doing:

```bash
# cd examples/narwhals/
python example.py
```
This will run both variants one after the other.

or running the notebook:

```bash
# cd examples/narwhals
jupyter notebook   # pip install jupyter if you don't have it
```
Or you can open up the notebook in Colab:
