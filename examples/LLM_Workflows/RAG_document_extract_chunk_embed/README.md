# RAG Document: Extract, Chunk, Embed Example

![pipeline-steps](pipeline-steps.png)

The notebook here explains how to build a simple pipeline that processes a page from Apache Hamilton's documentation.

Open it in google collab:
<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/blob/main/examples/LLM_Workflows/RAG_document_extract_chunk_embed/simple_pipeline.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open Me In Google Colab"/>
</a>

# File structure

* simple_pipeline.ipynb - this contains documentation and code. Read this.
* pipeline.py - what the code in simple_pipeline.ipynb creates for easy reference
* requirements.txt - python dependencies required (outside of jupyter lab)

To exercise this example you can run it in Google Colab:
