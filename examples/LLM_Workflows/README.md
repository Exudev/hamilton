Here you'll find a collection of workflows that demonstrate how to use Apache Hamilton
in various LLM contexts.

For more examples that you can pull off-the-shelf, we invite you to checkout [hub.dagworks.io](https://hub.dagworks.io),
and use the keyword `llm` to filter for LLM related examples.

Note, some examples have alternative implementations, such as PySpark or Ray. This is to demonstrate how
one could take the same code and scale it easily.
