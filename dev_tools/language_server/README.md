# Apache Hamilton Language Server (`hamilton_lsp`)

> **Disclaimer**
>
> Apache Hamilton is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
>
> Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
>
> While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

This is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to provide a rich IDE experience when creating Apache Hamilton dataflows.

It currently powers the Apache Hamilton VSCode extension and could be integrated into other IDEs.
